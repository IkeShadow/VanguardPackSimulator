# Vanguard-Pack-Simulator
A Simulator for Cardfight Vanguard Packs

Based on Code from Adroseis and Kirby_UK at https://github.com/adosreis/Yugioh-Pack-Opening-Simulator

Currently only contains up to Extra Set 1 with a few promos and is a basic terminal interface.
In order to run, please download the latest version of Python 3 (3.9 at time of writing) off of the Microsoft Store.
Navigate to the folder you downloaded this in in the terminal and execute the command "python.exe main.py" for windows, or "python3 main.py" for another OS.
